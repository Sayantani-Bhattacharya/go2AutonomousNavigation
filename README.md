# Multi Hetero Agent Exploration by Unitree GOs 

Author: Sayantani Bhattacharya

## Project Overview

To build a swarm of quadrupeds, capable of collaborative exploration missions, in hazardous/dangerous terrains.
Quadrupeds are ideal for moving in uneven areas like mines, forests, etc and thus chosen for the task. The aim is to 
build a system that performs localization, mapping, navigation and attention detection (can be a human/hazard prone area, 
depending on the task). Each quadruped would have these capabilities, and would also have the ability to merge the 
information from the agents in its vicinity (decentralized), to make a more robust system, and explore an area at the 
fastest possible speed. Agents would be aware of each-other’s presence and work in collaboration with each other.
